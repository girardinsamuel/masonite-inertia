# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for [masonite-inertia](https://github.com/girardinsamuel/masonite-inertia) adapter for [MasoniteFramework](https://docs.masoniteproject.com) and [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com).

## Why an other documentation ?

The existing documentation is really good but documents only official **Laravel** and **Rails** server side adapters. Here, you will find mostly the same content but written for [MasoniteFramework](https://docs.masoniteproject.com) !

This documentation is of course based on official [Inertia.js documentation](https://inertiajs.com), but will only explains how to use Inertia.js with MasoniteFramework and won't explain again how to configure and use it client-side as it's already covered in official documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Throughout the documentation, you will see that code examples are the same as the official server-side documentation in order to ease the understanding. If something is not clear please first go to official documentation to check if more details are given.
{% endhint %}

## Masonite 4

This adapter is compatible with Masonite 4 when using `4.X` version.

## Masonite 3

Old versions compatibles with Masonite 3 are available but won't receive new features anymore (use`3.X` version).

If you want to help me maintaining this package, feel free to [contribute](development/contribute.md).

## Official Inertia adapters

I am tracking new features and improvements added to official laravel-inertia adapter. I am trying to port those features on this adapter as well when I can.

Most important features are available in this adapter. The latest ones might not be there but feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/girardinsamuel/masonite-inertia/issues/new) for it and [any help](development/contribute.md) is welcome !
